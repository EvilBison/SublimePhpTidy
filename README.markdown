### Description

This is a little tool for formatting PHP code so that it conforms to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).

It is based on the [phptidy](http://phptidy.berlios.de/) script by Magnus Rosenbaum.

Modifications were made by Eoin Gallagher and described here:
